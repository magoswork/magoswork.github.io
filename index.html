        <h1>Hello.</h1>
        <p>
            I am Mago/Ronin, and this is my workspace. It's a bit of a mess, but it's a collection of everything that comes out of my brain. I intend to describe here everything I've ever intended to make. If I don't ever finish it (which, in human lifetimes, I probably won't), it <i>should</i> exist as a testament to my thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am fairly unintersted in polish here. This space is not a portfolio, a storefront, or a performance. Closer, it is, to a workbench. Things are to be left exposed. Ideas stored mid-construction. Some will never resolve. That is expected. If this persists beyond my direct involvement, let it stand as evidence of a mind in motion rather than a set of conclusions. The value is not in what was achieved, but in what was attempted and recorded before it could be forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is, additionally, the assumption that I will not be here forever. That most of this will outlast me by default, simply because I will die. If this survives intact, half-broken, or misinterpreted, I can accept that. It's strange to imagine somebody encountering this without me as context. Reading fragments of intent detached from the person who produced them. But there is something reassuring in that I guess, that my thoughts will persist beyond my existence. That some small internal weather system left marks after the self generating them is removed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If this remains accessible after I am dead and gone, let it be unclean and human. Let the gaps show. Let the unfinished parts remain unfinished. The continuity itself is the point. A record that something was here, thinking, building, and failing.
