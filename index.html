            I am Mago/Ronin, and this is my workspace. It's a bit of a mess, but it's a collection of everything that comes out of my brain. I intend to describe here everything I've ever intended to make. If I don't ever finish it (which, in human lifetimes, I probably won't), it <i>should</i> exist as a testament to my thoughts.
